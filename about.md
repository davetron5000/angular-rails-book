# About the Author

I'm David Bryant Copeland, otherwise known as [@davetron5000][twitter] on
Twitter, and am the author of [“Build Awesome Command-Line Applications in Ruby 2”][clibook]
and [“The Senior Software Engineer”][swengbook] (which is a book about
everything you need to know as a developer other than the coding part :).

I currently live in Washington, DC and am a Director of Engineering for retail innovator [Stitch Fix][stitchfixblog], working with a small team building software (mostly Rails apps) to support our business.
We use Angular for several of our internal applications.
To read more about how we're using it, see my blog post [Unassuming Apps w/ AngularJS][angular-post].

Prior to that, I supported several Rails internal APIs for LivingSocial, and
before *that* helped build the engineering team at energy-efficiency startup
Opower.

I focus on practical use of technology, as best documented on my blog in
either [Production is all that matters][prodpost] or [Responsible
Refactoring][refactorpost].  That's why this book is about getting your code
deployed and not what is theoretically possible.  Details matter to me.
