# About the Author

I'm David Bryant Copeland, otherwise known as [@davetron5000][twitter] on
Twitter, and am the author of [“Build Awesome Command-Line Applications in Ruby 2”][clibook]
and [“The Senior Software Engineer”][swengbook] (which is a book about
everything you need to know as a developer other than the coding part :).

I currently live in Washington, DC and am a Director of Engineering for retail innovator [Stitch
Fix][stitchfixblog], working with a small team building software (mostly Rails
apps) to support our business.  Two of those applications are Angular apps.

Prior to that, I supported several Rails internal APIs for LivingSocial, and
before that helped build the engineering team at energy-efficiency startup
Opower.

I focus on practical use of technology, as best documented on my blog in
either [Production is all that matters][prodpost] or [Responsible
Refactoring][refactorpost].  That's why this book is about getting your code
deployed and not what is theoretically possible.  Details matter to me.
