# The Application We'll Build

To frame all the setup needed to get an Angular app running with Rails,
we'll build a simple application to manage recipes.  The application will
simply be a store of recipes that can be searched.  A recipe is simply a title
and a set of instructions.

We'll build the application in four steps:

1. Create a skeleton that does very little but can be deployed.
2. Walk through the implementation of a basic search by name.
3. Walk briskly through a test-driven implementation of viewing a recipe.
4. Run through the implementation of creating, editing, and deleting recipes.

Again, since this isn't a Rails or Angular tutorial, we're going to accelerate
as we go.  The most difficult and tedious part of using a new technology is
setup, so let's do that first.
